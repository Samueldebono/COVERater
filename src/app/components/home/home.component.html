            Welcome to the COVERater. This free app is designed to train
            researchers and students to visually estimate the percentage cover
            of terrestrial and aquatic species accurately. Visually estimating
            the cover of species is advantageous to those: in the field, under
            time restrictions and sampling large numbers of quadrats.

        <div class="instruction-card">
          <img src="../../../assets/images/leaf2.png" class="instuction-img" />
          <p>
            To use this app and be trained successfully, you will estimate the
            amount of cover of the shown species on randomised images of
            different environments using the slider tool under the image.
            Answers range from 0% cover to 100% cover. The intervals of
            measurement consist of 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.25, 1.5,
            1.75. From 2% - 100% the intervals increase by 1%. After submitting
            your estimate, the correct answer will be displayed. Estimates that
            are within 0-1% of the actual answer are considered accurate (e.g.
            if the true answer is 5%, estimates of 4, 5 & 6% are considered
            accurate).

        <div class="instruction-card">
          <img src="../../../assets/images/leaf3.png" class="instuction-img" />
          <p>
            After estimating 10 images, a running average of your estimate
            accuracy will be displayed. Your training will continue for as long
            as it takes the running average of your last 10 images to reach
            98-100% accuracy. At the completion of training you will see your
            progress displayed in a graph.

            Estimating Tips:<br /><br />
            When estimating cover, <br />First, observe the features of the
            species shown, then match them to the species in the image
            displayed. <br />Take time to spot all of the different patches of
            this species to avoid overlooking any parts. <br />Make sure to
            include all parts of the shown species in your estimation e.g. leaf,
            stem and flower. <br />Then try to mentally visualise all parts of
            that species in the corner of the photo, or mentally divide the
            image into grids of different percentages (e.g. 10 grids of 10%, 4
            grids of 25% etc.) This will help determine your estimated
            percentages. <br /><br />Make sure to discount any dead terrestrial
            species from your estimation as well as any parts of the species
            overlapped by another species. In this training, you are only
            estimating the shown amount of species, not parts of the species
            that canâ€™t be seen in the image.
